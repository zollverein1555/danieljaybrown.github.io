I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School. 

I will be on the job market in Fall 2023.

My research interests focus on the role of human capital and labor institutions in the direction and organization of firm growth. My job market paper uses a series of changes in occupational licensing rules to examine the impact of resource redeployment costs on market entry, entry mode, and organizational structure.
