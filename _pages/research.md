"Entering Markets While Standing in Place: The Impact of Redeployment Costs on Entry Mode and Organizational Structure" (Job Market Paper)
This paper examines the impact of reduced resource redeployment costs on market entry,
entry mode, and organizational structure, using changes in state-level occupational licensing
rules for lawyers. The findings suggest that firms are more likely to enter a market when
redeployment costs drop, yet less likely to enter using a new physical establishment (greenfield
investment). Moreover, the study indicates that firms increase their managerial span of control in
response to lower redeployment costs. Relatedly, firms increase the level of worker specialization
since expanded market access enables workers to concentrate on a greater depth of specialized
knowledge. With these new opportunities for flexible firm expansion, firm performance improves
as redeployment costs decrease. Overall, these results imply that firms adopt new entry modes
and organizational structures when facing lower redeployment costs to effectively reallocate
resources as market conditions evolve.
